        <h2>Our Rich History</h2>
        <p>Founded in 2007 by visionary educators in Kenya, Zau Academy began as a modest institution with a single classroom block, driven by the goal of providing quality education amid the transition from the 8-4-4 system. Over the years, we've expanded to a state-of-the-art campus, serving over 500 students from diverse backgrounds. Our journey includes key milestones like full CBC integration in 2019, multiple national awards for academic performance, and partnerships with local NGOs for community outreach programs. Today, we continue to evolve, incorporating digital learning tools to prepare students for global opportunities.</p>
