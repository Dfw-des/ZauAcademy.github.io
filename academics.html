    <section id="curriculum">
        <h2>Our Comprehensive Curriculum</h2>
        <p>Zau Academy proudly offers a fully integrated Competency-Based Curriculum (CBC), seamlessly transitioned from the traditional 8-4-4 system to focus on practical skills and learner-centered approaches. Our curriculum aligns with Kenya's national standards, emphasizing seven core competencies: communication, critical thinking, creativity, digital literacy, learning to learn, self-efficacy, and citizenship. From early years to senior levels, students engage in project-based learning, such as environmental conservation initiatives tied to local Kenyan ecosystems, ensuring they gain real-world applicability alongside academic rigor.</p>
